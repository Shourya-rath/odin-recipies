    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Paneer Butter Masala is a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced North Indian curry made with paneer (Indian cottage
        cheese), tomatoes, butter, and a blend of aromatic spices. The dish is known for its velvety smooth texture,
        thanks to a luscious tomato-based gravy enriched with cashews and cream. The butter enhances the flavors, making
        it a popular choice in Indian restaurants and a favorite for special occasions</p>
    <p>This dish pairs exceptionally well with naan, roti, or jeera rice. The slight sweetness of the tomato gravy,
        combined with the mild spices and soft paneer cubes, creates a perfectly balanced dish. It is easy to prepare at
        home with simple ingredients and delivers restaurant-style taste in just a few steps.</p>
